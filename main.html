      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I am driven by one of humanity's most distinctive traits - the desire to create. As a Maker by trade and by heart, I am always seeking new challenges and achievements. Whether it's writing code, creating art, or finding innovative uses for old technology, I relish the process of discovery and creation. I also have a passion for reverse engineering, as I find it fascinating to uncover the mysteries behind how things were made and the reasoning behind it, which I then use to inspire my own unique ideas.</p>
